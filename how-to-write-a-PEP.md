title: How to Write a Plain English Exposition of a research paper
pagetype: reference
---


This how-to presentation assumes the writer is an expert on the research paper. We begin the description by describing some organizational thinking to be done by you, the writer. Do not begin by starting to write text. Instead just make notes addressing the next few questions we present. Also, as you work on this project start to make a list of possible guinea pigs you might ask to read your work when you have completly polished it. Keep in mind the ultimate objective of your plain english work: to excite the interest and appreciation of the interested lay public in your work. Besides, they are your tax paying patrons. 


#### Organizing the exposition

The first step in the process is to study the research paper and determine the key result of the paper. Everything written for the exposition must have that ONE key result in the background. In the researach paper presented here, the focus is on the doublinig of the beam energy. If the writer cannot find a good single point of focus in the selected research paper they should consider finding another paper to work with. From here we will refer to this one result as the "key result". 

The next thing to do is to develop why that key result is important to the general field of research or even to a larger context. Be sure that larger context is carefully chosen to be easily understood. Do not chose the larger context to be something that itself seems arcance. In the energy doubling example, the larger context is the importance of creating high energy particle beams for research and the challenge is that doing so is expensive so finding better cheaper ways is of high value. 

Finally, try to find some human interest story in the actually history of the research leading to the key result. In the energy doubling example, the need to build support for a new research facility provided human interest. 

Once this overall framework is worked out it is time to turn to developing the exposition but again, just make notes to yourself, dont's start writing text. Study the research paper and think about how you would explain it to someone begining with the descriptions developed above about key results, broader context and human interest. Think about what general physics concepts will also need to be explained. Try to organize those necessary physics concepts into a few tutorials that can standalone as explanations of the physics concepts.  (If you are trying to do this for another field, say biology, all the same ideas apply, just replace "physics" with "biology".) Think about how to tailor the physics tutorials to the needs of the explanation, that is, they should be both general and focused. In the energy doubling example, relativity obviously is essential to understaing high energy particles but we have kept the focus just on the mass formula but discussed it in some breadth and detail to maintain the drill down deep aspect of a research paper. 


#### Now start to write

Having thought about and worked out a coherent approach to these organizational issues and having made good notes on all your thoughts about them, it is finally time to start trying to write material. But don't rush to start writing anything but notes to yourself until you have developed a good starting roadmap to guide your writing. You will be writing a few different documents: an explanation ("exposition") of the research paper and a few clearly idenified tutorial subjects. As you write you will find ideas coming to you about any one of these documents and with each document you will find your awareness of various subsections they will require coming to mind. Feel free to jump from one document to another to write explanations as you have ideas. If an idea occurs to you and you can't work on the project at that time be sure to make a note of the idea that has enough detail that you can recall it later when you do have time to write. For this it pays to carry some kind of note taking material: a small paper pad and pen, a small voice recorder, an app on your smartphone, etc.

Now begin to write each document. You will probably find that sometimes it is not clear where a particular explanation belongs as it may overlap more than one document. Just pick the most natural place to put it at the present stage of devlopment and know that once you have rough drafts of all the documents that there will be a necessity to do some moving of content between documents as a part of the editing and revision process. 

If you intend to write more than one research paper exposition on the subject, think about the tutorials serving all the expositions. Each different research paper is nevertheless based on the same basic physics so for each tutorial subject write them in a way that they can be referenced by all the expositions. This may mean expanding a tutorial when you begin work on a second research paper exposition. 


#### On editing

Some thoughts on editing: The best writing is writing that flows for the reader. When you read a novel you want your mind to stay immersed in the story. You don't want "bumps" where you suddenly become aware that there was an author who wrote what you are reading. Perhaps you are taken out of the story this way because something suddenly doesn't make any sense and you are asking yourself, "what does the author mean?" Or perhaps, the author has tossed in something that distracts you in some other way, for example, reading a newspaper story you suddenly realize the author has just said something that makes you aware they have some kind of bias. 

One of the biggest risks for bumps in expository writing is the use of pronouns that leave the reader confused about which he, she or it is being referred to. But anything can cause a bump that leaves the reader confused. Allowing yourself to slip into technical jargon is another big risk because as a long time expert in the subject what is as simple as words like "red" or "tall" to you is actually sometimes jargon only really understood by you and your cohort of experts. You have to keep a keen eye out for lapses into jargon and either repalce it with plain english or let the reader join the cohort by explaining the jargon. 

If you have experience writing journal papers all of this may seem familiar except you are now writing for a totally different class of readers. In particular, economy of verbiage must now be replaced with the opposite, extensive explanation. You may find your plain english exposition plus tutorials contains ten times as many words as the research paper. 


#### Making web pages

If you intend to create web pages and use hyperlinks you will need to get some technical support person to help you set this up. It is not a simple process that you can learn from a Dummies book and besides, you want to keep your focus on the exposition. Do as much of the writing and revision as possible before putting your work in web pages because editing the content in web pages is a lot less convenient than editing in a word processor. 

Once you get the material in the form of a good first draft, and before you convert them to web pages start putting in the documents where you want to have links. That means in one document, mostly the exposition, you will have a link to a location in another document, usually a tutorial. If all the documents have been organized into subsections, it will usually work to have a link that goes to a subsection in another document. Noting where all the links originate and where they go can be done in your text editor before you convert the documents to web pages. Again, the principle is to do as much as possible in a text editor beofre "webifying" your documents because they are a lot harder to read and edit once they are cluttered up with web page html code. To indicate links in the text editor simply stick in your exposition something like [link to bunch integrity section/relativity tutorial] that will later be replaced with the proper html code for the link once the document is in web page format. 

#### Your guinea pigs

Do not ask your test guineq pigs to look at your work until you have it completely polished and ready to go. You don't want them to give you feedback on things you already knew yourself needed work. That will distract them from giving you new and helpful insights. On the other hand, before you give it to your guinea pigs, it does help to have someone who can read over your draft work to help you catch various kinds of mistakes and errors. Have at least one other expert read it over with great care to spot any subject matter errors, calculational mistakes, etc.
