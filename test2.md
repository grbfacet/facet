According to Einstein the energy of an object is 

<math mode="display" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = mc<sup>2</sup></math>

Where

	m = m0γ and
	γ = 1/(1-β2)1/2 and 
β = v/c. 

Writing it all out without the gamma and beta

	EEinstein = m0c2/(1-(v/c)2)1/2 and we solving for the inertial mass, m, 
	m = m0/(1 – (v/c)2)1/2.

When v = 0, when the particle is not moving, m = m0, the rest mass.

When v approaches c, m and hence E become infinitely large.

When v is greater than c the formula tells us the number for the energy and the mass become an imaginary number, a number with a √(-1) which is hard to understand what that might mean. And we can see that you can’t get a particle to v greater than c by starting with v less than c and pushing it because it has to pass through a stage of infinite mass which takes an infinite amount of energy.
