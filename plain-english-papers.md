Plain English Expositions

This is an experiment in communicating detailed scientific research to the interested general public. It is based on a concept suggested by the DZero Collaboration at Fermilab in the 1990s, the Plain English Paper. They astutely recognized that science proceeds by establishing and publishing specific focused results and these results are self-contained packets of information. But they are written in arcane jargon. 


The DZero Plain English Paper idea did not catch on, even at DZero. We believe the idea was sound but, as is often the case, the first attempts to implement a new idea can be flawed. Edison famously tried hundreds of versions of the incandescent light bulb before hitting upon the implementation that has lighted homes for a hundred years. Our implementation of the Plain English idea differs in important ways from the DZero version. Our version is based on an analysis of what worked and what didn’t work in the DZero version so we owe much credit to them if what we have developed here works.

DZero set brevity to be their standard for what constituted a useful Plain English Paper. It should be only a single normal 8.5x11 page in length. It’s just not possible to give a good exposition in one short page. You will see here in our version of the Plain English exposition how much material is required to give our exposition. We set a different standard, namely, that you should be able to read and understand the original journal paper. And to do that requires a lot of exposition. We have actually built in a few levels of possible “understanding” by giving you options to start with a very basic understanding and then go deeper and deeper if you choose.

To help elucidate concepts we use two web page text devices, hover and hyperlinks to additional material. By hovering the mouse over text marked xxx you can get a pop up short explanation. By following a hyperlink to another document you can get a more detailed discussion of a concept.


We want to give you a quantitative mathematical feel for the physics involved but when we use math in this exposition we will limit it to arithmetic and algebra, especially the use of exponents. Regarding calculus we will simply use one important result from calculus, the Taylor’s expansion although we offer a primer on how calculus would apply if we moved beyond arithmetic and algebra. 

If you dislike studying material on a screen you can printout the research paper, the plain English exposition of the paper and the physics tutorial. Each can be read separately but the plain English exposition and the tutorial are linked by references (hyperlinks) from the English exposition into the physics tutorial. Your printed versions will allow you to follow these links. 

Finally, here is an interesting quote from a Congressional leader:
The Science Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives recently held a series of hearings on science policy. The necessity for scientists to communicate their work to the public was highlighted. In the session, Communicating Science and Engineering in a Sound-Bite World, May 14, 1998.Chairman Sensenbrenner’s opening remarks include the following extended quote.

Albert Einstein once commented that "the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility." One would hope that this comprehensibility would be widely available to, and appreciated by, the public at large. But such does not appear to be the case. Indeed, it is one of the ironies of the modern age that although our society depends on science as never before, what scientists do is something of an enigma to most people. Ask people why they shun science and the answer you are likely to get it that science is, with apologies to Einstein, largely incomprehensible.

This view should not come as a surprise to anyone who has tried to wade through a scientific journal. Granted, these journals are not written for laymen, nor do I think they should be. But they are perhaps the most extreme example of the widening chasm between scientists and the rest of society. As Latin in the Middle Ages distinguished one as learned and of the upper classes, so scientific jargon today separates the scientific class from the general public. It is interesting to note that in the Enlightenment, when the formation of scientific societies flowered and science began to acquire many of the characteristics it has today, the language of science shifted from Latin to the vernacular.

If we are to maintain public support for our scientific enterprise, what is sorely needed today is a way to translate the grandeur of science into the language of ordinary people. Scientists have wonderful stories to tell, but too often their stories get told poorly, if at all. And while educators and journalists have a role to play in getting these stories out, scientists must also recognize that they, too, have a responsibility to increase the availability and salience of science to the public (emphasis added).
