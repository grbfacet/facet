### Units of measure prefixes indicate powers of ten:

The reader is probably familiar with the use of prefixes on units of measure in the metric system to indicate multiples or fractions of the unit of measure in powers of ten. The meter, a unit of length (about 3 ft), is abbreviated with the letter “m”. Just like we say 7 ft, we also say 13.2 m. Unlike the English system of measure we indicate 1000 meters as 1 km (one kilometer) and we indicate 1/1000th of a meter as 1 mm (one millimeter).  

Going up in multiples, 

<span class="eq">k for kilo indicates 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 (thousand),</span> 

<span class="eq">M for mega indicates 10<sup>6</sup> = 1,000,000 (million),</span> 

<span class="eq">G for giga indicates 10<sup>9</sup> = 1,000,000,000 (billion) and</span> 

<span class="eq">T for tera indicates 10<sup>12</sup> = 1,000,000,000,000 (trillion).</span> 

Sometimes in particle physics literature written a few decades ago, B was also used for a billion. 
The scale of energy reached by particles in current particle accelerators is in the 100 GeV to 10 TeV range.  We explain the eV energy unit below.

There is a corresponding series of notations for fractions of a unit. 

<span class="eq">1 m = 1 meter.</span> 

<span class="eq">1 mm (one millimeter) = 10<sup>-3</sup> m = one thousandth of a meter.</span> 

<span class="eq">1 µm (one micrometer/micron, where µ is the Greek letter mu) =10<sup>-6</sup> m = 1 millionth of a meter.</span>

<span class="eq">1 nm (one nanometer) = 10<sup>-9</sup> m = 1 billionth meter.</span> 

And further steps of one thousandth are pico (10<sup>-12</sup>) , femto (10<sup>-15</sup>) , atta (10<sup>-18</sup>).



### The electron volt, eV, an atomic sized unit of energy:

The eV is a unit of energy. One e is a unit of charge; it is the amount of charge of an electron, a proton and many other elementary particles. Electric charge comes in two kinds, positive and negative, and the charge of an electron is actually –e, where e is a positive number. One V (volt) is a unit of electric potential, the capacity to create energy, i.e., to do work, with an electric force. An electric potential is closely related to a force in that a charged particle, like an electron, will be pushed to move when it experiences an electric potential, V. And one eV is the energy of motion acquired by one particle that has the amount of charge e that is accelerated through a one volt electrical potential. 

An AA battery creates a 1.5 volt potential between it’s + and - ends. A single electron accelerated freely (“freely” is an important qualification explained later) would acquire an energy of motion of 1.5 eV. Energy of motion is called kinetic energy and is given in low velocity situations, far from the speed of light, by the Newtonian formula 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = ½ m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup>,</span> 

which is an approximation to the very famous and correct relativistic formula E<sub>Einstein</sub> = mc<sup>2</sup>.
E<sub>Newton</sub> is the Newtonian kinetic energy of motion, m<sub>0</sub> is the particle’s mass and v is the particle’s velocity.

Let’s compute how fast a freely accelerated 1.5 eV electron would move. To do this we will need a conversion factor between the atomic level unit of energy, the eV, and the macroscopic level of energy, the Joule: 

<span class="eq">1 eV = 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> J (Joules) where the units of a Joule are kg-m<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>.</span> 

The mass of the electron is 

<span class="eq">m<sub>e</sub> = 9.1 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg.</span> 

Calculation: Solve the Newtonian kinetic energy formula for velocity squared and then take the square root;

<span class="eq">v = (2E/m<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>.</span>  

Plug in the values for E and m<sub>e</sub> of the 1.5 eV electron and the energy units converstion factor;

<span class="eq">v = ( 2 x 1.5 eV x 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> J/eV / 9.1 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg)<sup>1/2</sup> .</span>

<span class="eq">v = ( 0.525 x 10<sup>12</sup> J/kg )<sup>1/2</sup> .</span>  

Since 1 J = 1 kg-m<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>, J/kg = m<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup> .

<span class="eq">v = ( 0.525 x 10<sup>12</sup>  m<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>,</span>

<span class="eq">v = 0.72 x 10<sup>6</sup> m/sec = 720km/sec ≈ 450 miles/second. End calculation.</span>

An electron accelerated freely by a 1.5 volt AA battery would reach a speed of 450 miles per second which is about 4000 times the speed of a passenger jet plane.  But this is still only about one quarter of a percent of the speed of light, so the use of the Newtonian approximation 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = ½ m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup></span> 

is OK as we will prove later. 

Relativity effects only begin to become important when particles reach, say 10 percent, at least, of the speed of light. As is explained elsewhere, the Newtonian formula, E<sub>Newton</sub> = ½ m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup>, begins to make a significant error only when we approach these “relativistic” speeds. 

4000 times jet speed is pretty fast, a bullet or a baseball with that speed could do a lot of damage but they are very heavy compared to an electron, so how can we get a sense of the 42 GeV electron energy in the energy doubling experiment? Remember our 4000 times jet speed was an electron accelerated only by one 1.5 volt AA battery. To get to 42 GeV we need 

<span class="eq">42 x 10<sup>9</sup>/1.5 ≈ 30,000,000,000 (thirty billion!) AA batteries connected in series.</span> 

42 GeV takes our electron very close to the speed of light as we will show later. 

There is something we should clarify here. When you put an AA battery in, say, a little radio, the electrons flow through the circuit but they don’t flow at the speed, 4000 times jet speed, we calculated above. They would only move that fast in a vacuum. In a circuit the electrons are constantly bumping into atoms in the wires. The electric potential starts to accelerate them and before they can go more than a few atomic sizes, they hit an atom and are deflected only to start accelerating again and then hit another atom. These collisions happen at very high rates and the net overall flow of the electrons, called their “drift” speed along the wire, is very slow, in the range of a meter per hour. The electrons are actually banging around at speeds vastly greater than their drift speed but most of that motion is sidewise and backwards and forwards. 

When the electrons hit atoms in the wire they cause the atoms to move slightly, that is they transfer some of their energy of motion to the wire’s atoms. The warmth of an object is actually the amount of random atomic motion, and this is why wires heat up when we run a current through them. With an old fashioned incandescent wire light bulb the wire gets so hot it begins to radiate energy in the visible light range of the spectrum. 

##### The beam bunch energy

An electron with 42 GeV of energy actually has a very small amount of energy.

<span class="eq">42 GeV = 42x10<sup>9</sup> eV x 1.6 x10<sup>-19</sup> J/eV = 67 x 10<sup>-10</sup> J.</span> 

But in the plasma acceleration experiment tiny bunches of 1.8 x 10<sup>10</sup> electrons at a time are used, so one entire bunch would have 

<span class="eq">1.8 x 10<sup>10</sup> electrons/bunch x 67 x 10<sup>-10</sup> J/electron =  121 J of energy per bunch.</span> 

How much energy is 121 Joules? Going back to 

<span class="eq">v = (2E<sub>Newton</sub>/ m<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> ,</span>

let’s think of a baseball which weighs 5 oz. At 28 grams/oz, that’s 

<span class="eq">5 x 28 = 140 grams/baseball = 0.14 kg/baseball.</span>

A baseball with 121 joules of energy will have a velocity of

<span class="eq">v = ( 2 x 121 J/0.14 kg )<sup>1/2</sup> = ( 1729 m<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> = 42 m/s.</span> 

What is that in mph? 

<span class="eq">42 m/s x 3600 s/hr = 150 km/hr = 93 mph.</span>

If you imagine being hit by a fastball thrown by a major league baseball pitcher that gives some sense of the punch packed by a 42 GeV bunch of electrons in our experiment. The SLAC Linac can produce 60 bunches per second so imagine being pelted by 60 pitchers simultaneously with each pitcher throwing a fastball at you every second. Ouch. 

### Relativity theory 

(This discussion of relativity focuses only on the aspects that are essential to understand high energy particle beams. We will not go into many famous aspects of relativity theory such as time dilation, length contraction, the twin paradox and others.) We begin with a mostly English exposition but we gradually add some math to get actual numbers to give a better feeling for the sizes of the effects involved. On a first reading you can skip over the calculations without a problem but if you desire to know how a physicist understands relativity, come back to the calculations and not only step through them in your mind but reproduce them yourself on a piece of paper using a calculator to do some of the arithmetic. It may take a little time and sometimes require figuring out exactly how a calculation was done, but that is when you will really get your ideas right. The education of a physicist through course work always involves an extensive amount of mathematical problem solving both in homework and tests, not to mention in the classroom lectures. 

To get a feeling for the way relativity affects this experiment, we explain how relativity applies to it and we will calculate some facts about 42 GeV electrons to try to give you a sense of how things work for sub-atomic sized particles moving at essentially the speed of light. 

##### The Newtonian theory of the energy of motion 

Before the discovery of the theory of relativity in 1905, the Newtonian theory was always used and it said the energy, E, of a body with mass, m<sub>0</sub>, moving with the speed v, was 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = 1/2 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup>,</span> 

This was believed to be accurate for all speeds. This demonstrates an important feature of physics. Theories that are quantitative supersede older theories, not by discovering that they were wrong in all cases but rather, by discovering that the older theory is actually an approximation to the newer theory, where the newer theory covers a wider range of situations than was available for experimentation during the reign of the older theory. This general rule only applies for theories which make numerical predictions. There must be numbers involved to give meaning to the idea of an approximation. For example, the theory that the earth was the center of the universe is not a numerical theory and it is not an approximation to our current view. The difference between, “the earth is the center of the universe” and “the universe has no center” are clearly not different by a mere approximation error.  


##### E=mc<sup>2</sup>: Einstein’s formula for the energy of motion

What formula superseded 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = ½ m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup> ? </span>

The famous 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = mc<sup>2</sup>.</span> 

Let’s unwrap what these formulas are telling us. First we need to be clear what m, the mass, means in both formulas. In the pre-relativistic, Newtonian ideas of mass, a body had a fixed amount of matter that was independent of its motion. In a way this is still true in relativity but in another way it is no longer true. We need to be more specific about what aspect of mass we are talking about. A lead ball might consist of a certain exact number of atoms of lead and that number would be unchanged no matter how the ball is moving even according to Einstein. And each lead atom would consist of a certain number of electrons, protons and neutrons and those numbers would also be unchanged by motion, Einstein would also agree. 

Another aspect of mass however does change with motion according to Einstein. In both Newtonian and Einsteinian theory of force and motion, mass is a measure of a body’s resistance to having its state of motion changed (i.e., accelerated) by a force. We also refer to this as the body’s inertia. We all know that you have to push a heavy body harder (with more force) than a lighter body to get equal motion. A normal adult can push a small auto and get it to roll. A dozen normal adults probably can’t budge a railway car on the tracks. That’s the amount of resistance to changing the motion of a body. We need to distinguish the amount of matter in a body which is unchanged by the state of motion and the inertia of a body which does change in relativity theory but does not change in Newtonian theory when a body moves faster. 

Newton’s F = ma tells us if we keep pushing a body with a constant force it will accelerate at constant rate to any speed we shoot for, even beyond the speed of light if we push long enough. But that assumes that m, the inertia does not change with increasing speed. If we solve the Newtonian energy formula for v we get

<span class="eq">v = (2E<sub>Newton</sub>/m<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>.</span>

If this were true at any speed, that is, if m0 was a constant independent of speed, what speed would a 42 GeV electron have? We have put the subscript 0 on m to indicate it is an unchanging constant. 

Calculation: Let’s calculate the speed of a 42 GeV electron just leaving the Linac accelerator and let’s do it “wrong”, let’s do it according to Newton’s formula. We need a couple numbers, the conversion of energy units between eV and Joules, 

<span class="eq">1 eV = 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> J</span> 

and ew need the rest mass of an electron, 

<span class="eq">m<sub>e</sub> = 9.1 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg.</span> 

The powers of ten involved in these numbers show the vast difference between the scale of ordinary human level phenomena and sub-atomic particles and it will just get stranger as we continue. Plugging in these two factors and doing some arithmetic we get

<span class="eq">v = ( 2 x 42 GeV / 9.1 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg )<sup>1/2</sup> ,</span>
	
<span class="eq">v = ( 2 x 4.2 x 10<sup>10</sup> eV x 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> J/eV / 9.1 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg )<sup>1/2</sup>,</span>

<span class="eq">v ≈ ( 1.5 x 10<sup>22</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> ≈ 1.2 x 10<sup>11</sup>m/sec.</span>


Since the speed of light, c = 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/sec 

<span class="eq">v ≈ 1.2 x 10<sup>11</sup> / 3x10<sup>8</sup> ≈ 400 times the speed of light. End of calculation.</span>

If Newton’s formula still was accurate at 42 GeV the electron coming out of the Linac would be going 400 times the speed of light! Since relativity tells us nothing can be accelerated to surpass the speed of light,we can see that the m term must be increasing a very great deal to thwart surpassing c. In fact, it will have to approach infinity as the speed approaches c, as we will see shortly.

##### The relativistic inertial mass formula

In relativity theory we denote the mass of an object at rest (not moving) as m<sub>0</sub> and call it the object’s rest mass. We denote the mass of the object as it moves simply by m and relativity tells us m gets bigger as the speed of the body increases. The formula is 

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/( 1 – (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup>,</span>  [add plot]

where c is the speed of light, 300,000 km/sec (186,000 mi/sec). 

This is a complicated unintuitive looking formula but we can tease out a feeling for it by considering different cases. 

First, it says the mass of a moving body depends on only two things: its rest mass, m<sub>0</sub>, and the ratio of its speed to the speed of light, v/c.  Further, no matter what situation we might be considering for the object, its rest mass, m<sub>0</sub>, and c will always be unchanged, those are what we call physical constants. All electrons have exactly the same rest mass no matter what their motion. In all situations, the speed of light is the same (this is the basis of relativity theory). Thus, what ultimately determines the inertial mass of a moving object is simply its speed, v. 

Now let’s look at some values for v. If the body is standing still, v = 0 and if you plug v = 0 into the mass formula and do the math you will see that m = m<sub>0</sub>; m standing still is the rest mass exactly as we wanted (more on this below). Now let’s go to another extreme value, what happens when v = c? We plug that in and we get infinity for the mass. Normal particles can’t exceed c by pushing because no matter how hard and how long you push to make it go faster as you get closer and closer to c all you are doing is adding to its mass energy (inertia) and less and less to its speed. Between the extremes of v = 0 and v = c we can see the mass formula predicts a positive number for the mass. 

You may wonder how light itself can travel at the speed of light? It can because for photons, light particles, 

<span class="eq">m<sub>photon</sub> = 0, they are massless! </span>

Suppose, however, that v is larger than c, say v = 2c. We find the mass is given by an imaginary number, a normal number multiplied by the square root of -1. Such postulated particles are called tachyons and nobody has ever seen one and if they do exist tachyons will behave strangely since other physics tells us they are particles traveling backwards in time. And we know we can’t get a normal particle to tachyon speeds by accelerating it because it has to acquire infinite mass first so we can only say we don’t know anything that makes tachyons impossible but we can say that we can’t create one in the obvious manner by accelerating an ordinary particle. So tachyons are not ruled out but since we don’t know how to make one and one has never been seen, they are not ruled in either.

Now let’s have a look at what happens between v = 0 and v = c. What about v = 18.6 miles/sec (30 km/sec)?(That may seem like an odd example speed to choose, but sometimes in this exposition we will make choices like that because it makes the arithmetic easier to follow later.)That’s a typical speed for objects in our solar system. A meteor or comet might hit the earth at that very high speed. The speed of light, c, is 186,000 mi/sec (300,000 km/sec) so you see why we choose 18.6 miles/sec, it’s one thousandth of c. Let’s plug v/c = 0.001 in the mass formula and we see that the mass, the inertia of the motion is 

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/( 1 - (0.001)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> ,</span>

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/( 1 – 0.000001 )<sup>1/2</sup> ,</span>

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/0.999999<sup>1/2</sup> ,</span>

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/0.9999995 ,</span>

<span class="eq">m = 1.0000005m<sub>0</sub>. </span> 

The inertia is only increased by a factor of one half of a millionth even at a speed of 18.6 mi/sec ( 30 km/sec), hardly a large amount. It’s no wonder no one noticed in Newton’s time. 

Calculation: Now let’s work backwards to find out how fast m<sub>0</sub> must be going to double its inertia. We want 

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/( 1 - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> = 2m<sub>0</sub>.</span> 

The two m<sub>0</sub> factors cancel and we want to solve for v starting with 

<span class="eq">1/( 1 – (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> = 2. Let’s move things around a little to get</span>

<span class="eq">( 1 - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> = ½. Let’s square both sides to get</span>

<span class="eq">1 – ( v/c )<sup>2</sup> = ¼. Let’s rearrange to get</span>

<span class="eq">( v/c )<sup>2</sup> = ¾. Now let’s take the square root of both sides to get</span>

<span class="eq">v/c = (3/4)<sup>1/2</sup> ≈ .87 or</span>

<span class="eq">v ≈ 0.87c. End of calculation.</span>


Thus, v is about 87% of the speed of light which is about 160,000 miles/sec when the inertial mass reaches double the rest mass. 

The inertia of an object only doubles by the time it reaches 87% of the speed of light. We can try a few more values for m, say m = 10m<sub>0</sub> and will find for that amount of inertia, v is about 99.5% of the speed of light. The inertia really starts to pile up very close to the speed of light. We saw from the famous Einstein formula for relativistic energy that the energy goes up in proportion to the mass. From this we can work out that there is very little difference in velocity if we double the energy of an electron from 42 to 84 GeV. 

By comparison, if the Newtonian formula were correct any time you double the energy of motion of an object you have increased its speed from v to √2v which is about a 40% increase for each doubling of the energy. Thus our normal sense that things really speed up as you push them harder is not true near the speed of light, instead they just get harder to push. It’s a little bit like eating. We eat for energy and up to a point a meal gives us some energy to move around. But if we eat a lot, our body just stores it as weight and a lot of weight makes it harder for us to move. 

Thus, our initial little electron bunch 12 µm long with all the electrons at same energy, 42 GeV, when it entered the plasma accelerator left it with with electron energies as high as 84 GeV, some at the original 42 GeV, and many that have lost energy to well below 42 GeV, as it leaves the plasma accelerator. But because they are already nearly the speed of light, the speed difference between them is so small that the bunch stays pretty much the same size (more on this later). This is, of course, not at all how we think about objects that are accelerated. The Porsche leaves the Prius in the dust with its more powerful engine. This is a great example of how what we know under conditions that our body size and our senses are familiar with may not at all be normal at more extreme conditions of speed where relativity replaces Newtonian laws or small size where quantum mechanics replaces Newtonian laws. And most subatomic physics processes require the simultaneous use of both new theories, relativity and quantum mechanics, to correctly explain what happens. 

### Where Newton approximates Einstein:

We stated above that Newtonian theory is an approximation to relativity theory. But when we look at the two formulas for energy, 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = 1/2 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup> and</span> 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>/( 1 - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup>.</span> 

It’s not at all obvious that the first is an approximation to the second. The way to make this more precise is that we want to see that the second one looks more and more like the first one when v/c gets smaller and smaller. We already noted that at v = 0 E<sub>Einstein</sub> does not equal 0 but E<sub>Newton</sub> does equal 0. So what is that about? We can use a Taylor series expansion of E<sub>Einstein</sub> to explore this issue. 

The Taylor series expansion of a function of a variable x, f(x), can be expressed as an infinite sum of terms:

<span class="eq">f(x) = f(0) + f’(0)x + (1/2)f’’(0)x<sup>2</sup> + (1/2x3)f<sup>(3)</sup>(0)x<sup>3</sup> + (1/2x3x4)f<sup>(4)</sup>(0)x<sup>4</sup> + …</span>

The nice thing for us about Mr. Taylor’s series can be seen if you consider a case where x is much smaller than 1 and close to 0. When you take a number smaller than 1 and near zero and calculate it’s powers (multiples of itself), those powers rapidly get much smaller. If 

<span class="eq">x = 0.1, then</span>

<span class="eq">x<sup>2</sup> = 0.01,</span>

<span class="eq">x<sup>3</sup> = 0.001,</span>

<span class="eq">… </span>

<span class="eq">x<sup>8</sup> = 0.00000001,</span>

<span class="eq">… .

And this means as you go further out in the sum of the Taylor series those terms are getting smaller fast whenever the f<sup>(n)</sup>(0) terms stay relatively small because the f<sup>(n)</sup>(0) terms are multiplied by two rapidly shrinking numbers, the 1/n! factor and the x<sup>n</sup> factors. (note: n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x (n-1) x n. ) This in turn means that f(x) is given to a good approximation by just the first few terms of the series when x is small. If we know the limits of our measurement precision we can actually specify where to meaningfully cut off the series sum. 

Calculation: Let’s apply the series to something fairly simple to see how it works. Consider a formula like 

<span class="eq">f(x) = ( 1 + x )<sup>1/2.</sup></span>
 
The first term in the series, f(0) means to replace x with 0 in the formula giving

<span class="eq">f(0) = ( 1 + 0 )<sup>1/2</sup> = 1<sup>1/2</sup>  = 1.</span>

From calculus f’(x) the first derivative of f(x) is given by

<span class="eq">f’(x) = d/dx( 1 + x )<sup>1/2</sup> = ½(1 + x)<sup>-1/2</sup> and thus</span>
	
<span class="eq">f’(0) = ½( 1 + 0 )<sup>-1/2</sup> = ½(1)<sup>-1/2</sup> = ½.</span>
 
Going one more term

<span class="eq">f’’(x) = d/dx( 1/2( 1 + x )<sup>-1/2</sup>) = (1/2)(-1/2)( 1 + x )<sup>-3/2</sup> and thus</span>

<span class="eq">f’’(0) = (1/2)(-1/2)(1) = -1/4.</span>

Then the first three terms of the Taylor series for ( 1 + x )<sup>1/2</sup> are

<span class="eq">f(x) ≈ 1 + ½x – ¼ x<sup>2</sup> .</span>

For x = 0.1 according to Mr. Taylor,

<span class="eq">f(0.1) ≈  1 + ½ x 0.1 – ¼ x (0.1)<sup>2</sup> = 1 + 0.05 - 0.0025 = 1.0475.</span>

Plugging x = 0.1 in the original formula, f(x) = ( 1 + x )<sup>1/2</sup> and using a calculator good to several decimal places

<span class="eq">f(0.1) =  ( 1 + 0.1 )<sup>1/2</sup> = √(1.1) = 1.0488.</span>

The error between the approximation by three terms of the Taylor series and the calculator (“true”) value is

<span class="eq">1.0488 – 1.0475 = 0.0013</span> 

or about one part in a thousand and we only took the first three terms of the Taylor expansion. If we added more terms the error would rapidly get smaller. End calculation. 


What happens when we apply the Taylor expansion to 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>/( 1 - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> ?</span> 

Calculation: Let’s rewrite this as

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>γ(β) where γ(β) = 1/( 1 – β<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> and β= v/c</span> 

and let’s expand γ(β) using Mr. Taylor’s expansion. If you know some calculus check the math, we will just give the result

<span class="eq">γ(β) = ( 1 – β<sup>2</sup> )<sup>-1/2</sup> = 1 + 1/2β<sup>2</sup> + 1/4β<sup>4</sup> + …</span>

Now let’s plug in 

<span class="eq">β = 0.01, i.e., v = 0.01c = 3000km/sec = 1860mi/sec.</span>

<span class="eq">γ(0.01) = 1 + 0.5 x 0.0001. + 0.25 x 0.00000001 + …</span>

<span class="eq">γ(0.01) ≈ 1.0000500025. End of calculation.</span>

This tells us that the first two terms, 1 and 0.00005, dominate all the rest (actually, the first term dominates the second but we include the second term for a reason to be seen shortly.) To good approximation for v a small fraction of c, we get

<span class="eq">γ(β) ≈ 1 + 1/2β<sup>2</sup>.</span>

Let’s put this back in E<sub>Einstein</sub>:

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>γ(β) ≈ m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> ( 1 + 1/2β<sup>2</sup> ) ≈  m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> + 1/2 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup>.</span>

We can rewrite that as

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> ≈ m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> + E<sub>Newton</sub> ! </span>

This tells us that when a body is standing still, i.e. when v = 0, i.e. when E<sub>Newton</sub> = 0 that E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>. This is the best way to understand the idea that mass and energy are inter-convertible. Given that c<sup>2</sup> is a very big number it tells us that a small amount of mass might be convertible into a large amount of energy and that is the basis of the nuclear reactions of fission (atomic bomb, nuclear reactors) and fusion (hydrogen bomb and the energy released by a star’s “burning” of hydrogen and other elements). When a uranium atom fissions into parts, the sum of the weights of the parts is less than the weight of the original atom and that tiny missing weight is converted to very rapid motion, kinetic energy of motion, of the results of the break up (fission) of the uranium atom. 

For most processes we study, rocket ships, accelerated electrons, etc. the first term, the rest energy, is unchanged in the process as we are not changing the particle composition of, say the electron, we are only accelerating it so that term is the same before and after acceleration and the difference is only in the terms that involve a power of the velocity so we can rewrite 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> of motion = E<sub>Newton</sub> + 1/4 m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>β<sup>4</sup></span>

<span class="eq">= 1/2 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup> + 1/4 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>4</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> + even smaller terms when v/c is small.</span>

Since the second term (the v<sup>4</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> term) is very small for ordinary velocities observable in Newton’s time, all measurements would have agreed with Newton’s theory within the measurement precision of his time. Thus, his theory passed every test and was believed to be “true”. It was only with advances in technology in the 19th century that measurements begin to indicate something was not right but it took about half a century for Einstein to figure out what was wrong and come up with his theory of relativity which agreed with Newton at low velocities but differed at high velocities and explained the anomalies that had been noticed. 

Actually, Einstein’s theory was there for anyone to see as far back as the 1860s, hidden in the new Maxwell’s unified theory of Electricity and Magnetism but to see it one had to throw off some very natural assumptions made by Newton and see the world in a way that disagreed with ordinary human experience. That was the genius of Einstein to make that leap. (Actually, at the time the anomaly was considered a flaw in Maxwell’s theory, not Newton’s. It was Einstein that turned the picture around and said Maxwell was right and Newton had it wrong.)

When some crazy people first claimed the earth actually rotated about its axis and if you were on the equator you were actually moving at a speed of about 1000 miles/hour, this was obviously not true. We should be thrown violently around. They deduced the rotation of the earth from observing the motion of the sun and stars across the sky and said it was a lot simpler to conclude the earth rotated. But that didn’t agree with ordinary experience and to explain that discrepancy ultimately required Newton’s theories of motion and gravity. New and better theories often require rethinking ideas that seem unshakably true. 

We have developed some examples and described various ways of thinking about relativity in the context of accelerated electrons. Their behavior is very unintuitive for non-physicists. Through constant use, a physicist begins to feel they have an intuitive grasp of what’s going on. That comes with training and experience over years of practice often doing calculations just like the examples here. To learn more, there have been many good expositions of relativity theory for the lay person. Einstein himself wrote a lucid layman’s guide that is still in print after nearly a century. 

Physicists commonly help their thinking by considering extreme cases. We did that when we looked at the mass formula for the extreme cases of v equal 0, c and 2c. George Gamow wrote a nice little book for lay people about a mythical Mr. Tompkins. Gamow’s approach was to wonder what ordinary daily experience would be like if the speed of light was slower, 10 miles per hour! Mr. Tompkins needs to go shopping and hops on his bike and starts to peddle. At first his speed picks up rapidly but as he gets to around 7 mph it begins to be a little harder to peddle faster. We noted at v = 0.87c the mass of an object doubles. If c is 10 mph then Mr. Tompkins is peddling a system (bike + himself) that weighs twice as much when he reaches 8.7 mph (87% of his c). And it quickly gets worse as he peddles harder and harder, barely increasing his speed with more and more effort but he continues to seem heavier and heavier. 

We said we wouldn't discuss relativity beyond simply applying the mass formula to electrons. But we need to alert you to avoid making some incorrect assumptions. You may get the impression that Mr. Tompkins himself is struggling to peddle but actually, he would not notice anything unusual. He would continue to peddle at the same rate _from his point of view on the bike_. From our point of view watching him go by he would seem to be peddling slower and slower because of increasing intertia. That is the famous time dilation effect, as we watch him his clocks seem to slow down and his steady peddling is just a kind of clock.

### Relativity and plasma acceleration of electron bunches

Particle accelerators get particles moving very near the speed of light and behavior is very different there than at speeds we are used to in daily life. We showed above that even for speeds many miles per second the difference between the Newtonian and the relativistic behavior is almost indistinguishable. Now we want to have a look at near the speed of light where the particles in our accelerators operate. We have explained elsewhere that the plasma acceleration experiment involved 12 µm long bunches of electrons. The electrons at the front of the bunch gave up energy to create the ionized plasma and the plasma created the electric field which in turn accelerated electrons at the back of the bunch. 

If Newtonian physics described these electrons we would have the lead electrons slowing down because they lost energy and the trailing electrons speeding up because they are accelerated and the net result would be for the electrons to switch places and the newly accelerated leading electrons would now lose energy to accelerate the electrons that previously were decelerated. Sometimes a team of runners or bicyclists train in a single file column. The lead person breaks the wind for the rest and thus, they are expending more energy than the rest. When they tire, they drop back to the tail end of the column and the next person in line breaks the wind. So why doesn’t this happen for the relativistic case as well since it involves lead electrons losing energy to accelerate trailing electrons in the 12 µm long bunch? 

To give an idea of the difference between ordinary and relativistic experience we will make up some examples with numbers that are easy to work with just to get a feel for what is happening. Let’s compare a 1 GeV and a 100 GeV electron. According to Newton’s E = 1/2 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup> if we take the ratio of the two energies we get

<span class="eq">100 GeV/1 GeV = (v<sub>100</sub>/v<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> and solving</span>

<span class="eq">v<sub>100</sub> = 10v<sub>1</sub>.</span>

At ten times the velocity, the 100 GeV electrons would cover any given distance 10 times as fast as the 1 GeV. So in the time it takes a 1 GeV electron to move the length of a bunch, the 100 GeV electron would have moved ten bunch lengths. Clearly, for a bunch to stay together as it traveled the one meter length of the plasma accelerator, they have to be pretty close in energy if Newton were correct. 

Calculation: Let’s now look at the situation from Einstein’s point of view.

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>/( 1 – β<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup>, where β = v/c.</span>

Let’s rewrite that as

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub>/m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> = 1/( 1 – β<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> .</span>

If we plug in the mass of an electron and multiple it by c<sup>2</sup> and convert units we find 

<span class="eq">m<sub>e</sub>c<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.5 MeV, (where m<sub>e</sub> = m<sub>0 </sub>of the electron).</span>  

This is a number every particle physicist knows better than they know their spouse's birthdate. Let’s consider a 7 GeV electron just to make the math simple later

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub>/m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> = 7 x 10<sup>9</sup> eV/ 0.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> eV = 1.4 x 10<sup>4</sup> = 1/( 1 – β<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> .</span>

Square both sides and do a little arithmetic

<span class="eq">1 – β<sup>2</sup> = 2 x 10<sup>-8</sup>,</span>
	
<span class="eq">β<sup>2</sup> = 1 - 2 x 10<sup>-8</sup>,</span>
	
<span class="eq">β = ( 1 – 2 x10<sup>-8</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> = ( 1 - 0.00000002 )<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.99999998<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.99999999 = 1 – 10<sup>-8</sup>,</span>
	
<span class="eq">β = v/c = 1 – 10<sup>-8</sup>,</span>

<span class="eq">v = ( 1 – 10<sup>-8</sup> ) c,</span>

<span class="eq">v = c – 10<sup>-8</sup>c = 300,000,000 m/sec – 3 m/sec. End of calculation</span>

The 7 GeV electron is only 3 m/sec slower than the speed of light! Even if the fastest electron were going at the speed of light (not possible), the “slow” 7 GeV electron would only be falling behind at the rate of 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>. Over the one meter length of the plasma accelerator the 7 GeV electron would fall behind any faster electron by, at most, about 10<sup>-8</sup> meters ( 10<sup>-2</sup> µm)  which is about one thousandth of a bunch length ( 12 µm). Therefore, all the electrons stay pretty much in their same location in the bunch, those at the head stay at the head and continue to give up energy and those at the tail stay there and keep gaining energy. Thus, assuming the model of how plasma acceleration works is correct, this experiment demonstrates convincingly that Einstein’s improvement of Newton’s idea is correct. 


##### The electron bunch stays together in the plasma accelerator

Before entering the plasma accelerator, all the electrons experienced the same accelerating force in the Linac to get them all to 42 GeV. Once they enter the plasma accelerator, things change drastically. The electrons at the head of the bunch experience a force against their motion as they give up energy to create the ionized plasma surrounding the bunch and the electrons at the tail of the bunch are accelerated forward by the field of the ionized plasma cloud of electrons. Unlike in the Linac where all the electrons get the same push forward and thus have the same energy and same speed, in the plasma accelerator they start getting different pushes and we asked why the bunch stayed together.

We have seen that the Einstein theory of relativity reduces to the Newtonian theory at low speeds relative to the speed of light, speeds we are familiar with in our normal lives. But at speeds nearing the speed of light, the Newtonian theory is completely wrong. The Newtonian theory says a force applied over a distance does work on an object thus increasing both the energy and the speed of the object. But as we approach the speed of light and relativity comes into play, more and more of that energy goes into increasing the inertial mass of the object and less and less goes into increasing its speed. 

This explains how the electron bunch stays together despite some electrons losing energy while others gain energy. We make an analogy with a pack of marathon runners nearing the finish line after all running at the same speed for most of the race (metaphorically equivalent to traveling in the Linac). (Metaphorically entering the plasma accelerator) some at the front of the pack start to run out of energy reserves and have less energy to put into running while others at the back of the pack stage a finishing kick by drawing on remaining energy reserves. In our world where they are running about 12 miles an hour the pack spreads out. But in a Gamowian Mr. Tompkins world where the speed of light is just barely above the speed of the pack, let’s say, 12.01 miles per hour we would find that the tiring runners (at the front of the pack) having less ability to push themselves don’t actually slow down very much, instead they seem to lose weight allowing them to maintain the speed of the pack with less effort!!! And the ones (at the back of the pack) with the finishing kick that push themselves harder don’t speed up much and thus don’t gain much on the runners at the front of the pack. Instead they seem to become heavier requiring more effort to maintain their pace!!! To be precise, the lead runners do lose a tiny amount of of their lead and the tail runners gain a tiny amount on the leaders but the changes are a tiny fraction of the lenght of the pack. Such is the world of near light speed phenomena. And plasma acceleration would not work without this peculiar effect of nature keeping the electron bunch intact and in the same order! 

Expressed mathematically, this is the difference between

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = ½ m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup> and</span>

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>/( 1- (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup>.</span>

If you have followed the math in the tutorial you should have a sense of how this strange formula creates this marvelous relativistic effect. 


### To summarize

We noted that the Linac produced bunches of 1.8 x 10<sup>10</sup> electrons with 42 GeV of energy per electron. This is the equivalent of the energy of a baseball thrown at 93 mph. Since the Linac was producing 60 bunches per second, one might imagine what it would be like to have 60 major league baseball pitchers each hitting us with a fastball every second.

According to Newtonian theory the energy of motion of an object is 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Newton</sub> = 1/2 m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup> .</span>

Solving for velocity of a 42 GeV electron according to Newton we found that

<span class="eq">v = 400c, where c is the speed of light,</span>

which violates what we have all heard that nothing can be pushed to travel faster than c. 

According to Einstein the energy of an object is 

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = mc<sup>2</sup>.</span>

Where

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>γ(β) and</span>

<span class="eq">γ(β) = 1/( 1 - β<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> and</span> 

<span class="eq">β = v/c .</span>

Writing it all out without the gamma and beta

<span class="eq">E<sub>Einstein</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>/( 1 - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> and we solve for the inertial mass, m,</span> 

<span class="eq">m = m<sub>0</sub>/( 1 – (v/c)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup>.</span>

When v = 0, when the particle is not moving, m = m<sub>0</sub>, the rest mass.

When v approaches c, m and hence E become infinitely large.

When v is greater than c the formula tells us the number for the energy and the mass become an imaginary number, a number with a √(-1), which is hard to understand what that might mean. And we can see that you can’t get a particle to v greater than c by starting with v less than c and pushing it because it has to pass through a stage of infinite mass which takes an infinite amount of energy.

Then we went on to look at what happens between v = 0 and v = c, the realm of objects we deal with in life and science. We found that for an object traveling at speeds in the range of a comet hitting the earth, v ~ 18.6 miles/sec that even at this very high speed m is little changed

<span class="eq">m ≈ 1.0000005m<sub>0</sub>, a one half millionth increase.</span>

To make a noticeable difference in the mass, say to double the mas, we found we needed

<span class="eq">v ≈ 0.87c, the particle is moving at 87% of the speed of light.</span>

For a tenfold increase of mass 

<span class="eq">v = 99.5% of the speed of light.</span>

Since the rest mass of an electron is 0.5 MeV the velocity of a 7 GeV electron is

<span class="eq">v ≈ ( 1 – 10<sup>-8</sup> )c, about one millionth percent shy of the speed of light.</span>

Finally, we noted that according to Newton any time you double the energy of motion you increase speed by about 40%. In the energy doubling experiment, the particle bunch is tiny and all the electrons are at essentially the same energy when they enter the plasma accelerator. After traveling one meter in the plasma accelerator the electrons’ energies ranged from around 84 GeV down to 5 GeV. Intuitively this should cause the bunch to spread out a great deal, yet we found that the velocity difference between the electrons was about one part in 10<sup>8</sup> and over the distance of one meter this hardly affects the particle’s location in the bunch.
